This project presents a real-time autonomous navigation system for robots that relies on coordinate-based map inputs rather than GPS sensors. 
The system allows users to define a start point and a destination directly on a web-based Leaflet map. Once the points are selected, the robot navigates efficiently using a hybrid path-planning approach that integrates A*, Dijkstra, and Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO) algorithms. These algorithms work together to determine the optimal route, balancing efficiency and adaptability.
The robot is controlled by an ESP32 microcontroller, which receives movement commands from a Python Flask backend. The backend is responsible for calculating the route, managing dynamic replanning, and providing real-time updates on the robot’s position. The robot is equipped with ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles along its path.
When an obstacle is detected, the system dynamically recalculates the route to ensure safe navigation.
The system also includes a real-time visualisation interface, showing the robot’s position, planned route, and detected obstacles on the map. This allows users to monitor the robot’s progress and decision-making process during navigation.
By combining hybrid path-planning algorithms, sensor-driven obstacle detection, and map-based coordinate navigation, the project demonstrates a practical and flexible approach to autonomous navigation in indoor or campus environments. The system is suitable for robotics research, educational demonstrations, and applications where GPS may be unavailable or unreliable.
